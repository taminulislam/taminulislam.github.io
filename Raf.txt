<p>Iâ€™m a prospective graduate student; actively looking for a Ph.D. position in computer science. My research interest lies in machine learning, cybersecurity, healthcare, and plant disease.
   <br>Recently I got my GRE score and achieved overall 329 (Verbal: 168, Quantitative: 157, Analytical: 4), and IELTS Overall Band Score 7.5. I strongly believe that my qualifications and experiences will prove that I am a suitable fit for any RA position. I am also actively collaborating in research that aligns with my research interests.
